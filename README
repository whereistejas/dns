This is a very simple and minimal DNS resolver. My fingers had been itching for the longest time to write something low-level and this repository is me scratching that itch.

This DNS resolver basically implements deserializing DNS responses defined by RFC 1035, handling message compression.

This library exposes the `resolve_domain` method which returns a list of `IpAddr`s for the given domain.
